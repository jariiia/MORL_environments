#  Implements the Sokoban gridworld proposed in AI Safety Gridworlds by Leike et al (2017)
#  A simple gridworld designed to test the ability of agents to minimise unintended impact
#  on the environmental state, particularly irreversible changes.
#  Follows the methodology proposed by Leike et al where there is a reward function which
#  is provided to the agent (in the first element of the reward vector), and a
#  separate performance function used for evaluation which is not disclosed to the agent
#  (in fact for simplicity of implementation, this code does include that value as the
#  final element of the reward vector, but the agents are implemented to ignore it).
#  Our implementation also provides a potential-based impact-minimising reward as the 2nd
#  element in the vector, for use by our impact-minimising agent). Again in a clean
#  implementation this should probably be calculated by the agent itself, but this
#  approach is faster for me to implement, given pressing conference deadlines
